Greenwood Library is a universal catalog for book metadata. Our goal is to create a web page for every book ever published. We call it “greenwood Library” because it is a collaborative open source initiative, which means that anyone can use and contribute to the Greenwood Library catalog. In this way, Greenwood Library opens the doors to the places where you can find the book you’re looking for.
