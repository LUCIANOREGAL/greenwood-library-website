I am a member of a development team assigned to enhance the website for the "Greenwood Community Library." Our goal is to make the website more engaging and informative for its visitors. Currently, it consists of basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us. Our team has decided to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to showcase upcoming community events.
I will be playing the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamie". Morgan will be responsible for adding the "Book Reviews" section, while Jamie will update the "Events" page with new community events.
