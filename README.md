# Greenwood Community Library Website

Welcome to the README file for the Greenwood Community Library Website project

## Project Overview

We are currently working on enhancing the Greenwood Community Library website to make it more engaging and informative for its visitors. The current version includes basic sections such as Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us. Our development team has expanded the website's features by adding a 'Book Reviews' section and updating the 'Events' page to showcase upcoming community events. I will be playing the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamie". Morgan will be responsible for adding the "Book Reviews" section, while Jamie will update the "Events" page with new community events.
